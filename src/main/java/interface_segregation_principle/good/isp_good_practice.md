### Why it's good:

The separation of `Workable` and `Eatable` interfaces ensures that classes like `Robot` are not forced to implement irrelevant methods, adhering to the **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**.

**Benefits include:**

- **Relevance:** The `Robot` class now only implements the `Workable` interface, which is relevant to its behavior. This keeps the class focused on its actual responsibilities.
- **Simplified Maintenance:** With clearly defined interfaces, classes remain simpler, easier to understand, and easier to maintain, as they don't include unnecessary or irrelevant methods.
- **Flexibility:** Other classes, such as `Human`, can implement both `Workable` and `Eatable` if needed, without forcing unrelated behavior on other classes. This promotes flexibility and scalability in the system.
- **Cleaner Design:** By ensuring that each class only depends on the methods it actually needs, the design becomes more modular and adheres to the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** as well.
- **Reduced Risk of Bugs:** Fewer methods in each class mean there is less chance of misuse or errors during development and less need for testing methods that aren't relevant to certain objects.

By following ISP, this approach ensures that the system remains robust, easier to extend, and free from unnecessary complexity.
