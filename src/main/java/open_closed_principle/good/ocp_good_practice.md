### Why it's good:

The `AreaCalculator` class is now **open for extension** but **closed for modification**, adhering to the **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**. This design allows new shapes to be added by extending the `Shape` interface without altering the existing `AreaCalculator` code.

**Benefits include:**

- **Scalability:** Easily introduce new shapes without impacting existing functionality.
- **Maintainability:** Reduces the risk of bugs since the core `AreaCalculator` logic remains unchanged.
- **Flexibility:** Supports a variety of shapes through polymorphism, allowing the system to handle new requirements seamlessly.
- **Reusability:** Encourages the creation of reusable shape classes that can be integrated into different parts of the application.
- **Cleaner Codebase:** Promotes a modular architecture where each shape encapsulates its own area calculation logic, leading to a more organized and understandable codebase.

By following the OCP, the system becomes more robust and easier to manage as it evolves, ensuring long-term sustainability and adaptability.
