### Why it's good:

Now, the separation of `FlyingBird` and `Bird` interfaces ensures that the `Ostrich` class does not inherit flying behavior it cannot perform. This design adheres to the **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** by allowing subtypes to be replaced without breaking the program.

**Benefits include:**

- **Correct Substitution:** The `Ostrich` class no longer inherits the ability to fly, preventing situations where non-flying birds are expected to fly. This allows for safe substitution of bird subtypes.
- **Clearer Abstraction:** By separating the `FlyingBird` and `Bird` interfaces, the system clearly differentiates birds that can fly from those that cannot, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
- **Extensibility:** New bird types (whether they fly or not) can be added without breaking existing functionality, making the system more flexible and scalable.
- **Adheres to LSP:** Subclasses can now be used interchangeably with their parent class without altering program behavior, ensuring that the application remains robust and predictable.
- **Reduced Code Complexity:** No need for special checks or conditions for flight behavior, as only appropriate bird types implement the `FlyingBird` interface.

By respecting the LSP, this design fosters a more maintainable and extendable system while eliminating the risks associated with inappropriate inheritance.
