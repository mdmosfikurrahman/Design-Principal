### Why it's bad:

The `AreaCalculator` class is not closed for modification. Every time a new shape is added, the method `calculateArea` needs to be changed, violating the **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**. The OCP states that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification. By having to modify the `AreaCalculator` each time a new shape is introduced, we risk:

- **Introducing Bugs:** Changes in the existing logic may unintentionally break the current functionality.
- **Reduced Maintainability:** The class becomes harder to maintain as it grows with more shape types and logic.
- **Scalability Issues:** Extending the functionality to support new shapes requires modifying the class, which limits its scalability and flexibility.
- **Code Duplication:** The logic for each shapeâ€™s area calculation may get tangled within the same method, making the code harder to read and increasing the risk of code duplication.

This design leads to a rigid and error-prone system, which is not adaptable to changes.
